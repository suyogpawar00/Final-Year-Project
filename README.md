# Final-Year-Project
The project introduces a quantum-inspired fraud detection approach using Qiskit's Quantum Circuit to enhance data representation and a Quantum Neural Network (QNN) for classification. Experiments show high precision and recall, with advanced techniques addressing class imbalance. Challenges and future research are discussed.
